S2S catchment water-balance Bayesian network — AIFS-ENS v2 / Icechunk / RxInfer.jl

Adapted from bn-ibf `flood_ibf/flood_bn_ibf_v1.jl` (ICPAC IBF team) to the grouped PROCESS
ontology of `qd-1.md.txt` and to what the AIFS-ENS v2 Icechunk store actually contains.

SCOPE (2026-08-06, DIRECTION_EXPLANATION_FIRST.md): this network is a DOWNSTREAM CONSUMER, not
the primary product. The pipeline's primary output is now the circulation explanation record
(`s2s_bn_evidence_prep.py --explain-out`) — ensemble counts over circulation states with the
effective sample size attached. This BN consumes the same loci and adds the risk framing on
top, but its lower half (`P(W|P,A)`, `P(RO|W)`) is elicited and unverifiable until the
observation side exists, and its antecedent node is a model proxy. Read its output as a
structured hypothesis about catchment water balance, NOT as a calibrated risk product. The
mechanism below is unchanged; only its status is.

What changed from the flood original, and why (full argument in S2S_BN_ONTOLOGY.md):

  * TARGET.  The original targets flood risk at a 0-7 day lead. This store holds hours
             432-792 (days 18-33) ONLY. At that lead the honest endpoint is qd-1's
             "catchment water-balance pressure" — an ordered surplus/deficit tendency that
             serves BOTH flood and drought reasoning — not a flood probability.
  * DAG.     Flat 5-parent expert CPT  ->  a physical CHAIN of process groups:
                 C -> M -> R -> P ,  (P, A) -> W ,  W -> RO
             so correlated meteorological fields never appear as sibling parents (the
             double-counting failure the original's `avoid this structure` warns about).
  * EVIDENCE. The 50 members give ONE joint draw over the whole chain each, so the chain
             CPTs are COUNTED from the joint member sample (see s2s_bn_evidence_prep.py)
             rather than elicited. Default `--evidence-mode chain` therefore attaches
             ensemble evidence only where it is independent (C, A, RO) and lets the counted
             CPTs carry it downstream — attaching it at every node would re-count the same
             50 members up to six times. `--evidence-mode all` reproduces the naive port and
             warns.
  * SEAM.    P(W | P, A) and P(RO | W) are ELICITED, not counted — no observation in this
             system can yet supply them (Route E). They are ordinal-kernel CPTs whose width
             is a stated, tunable uncertainty, wider for the later lead window.
