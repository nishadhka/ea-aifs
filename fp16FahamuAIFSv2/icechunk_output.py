"""
Icechunk ensemble output writer for AIFS-ENS-2.0 (Path A — **local** variant).

Implements the writer specified in ``ICECHUNK_PATH_A.md`` §2.1, but targets a
**local filesystem** Icechunk store (``icechunk.local_filesystem_storage``) instead
of GCS. Everything else — the ``(member, time, values)`` schema, the ``(1, n_steps,
n_values)`` chunking that lets members own disjoint chunks, the one-commit-per-member
ACID model — is identical, so this store is a drop-in for the GCS one and reads back
the same way with ``xarray.open_zarr``.

Use for on-box runs where the GPU inference writes straight into a store on a local
disk (e.g. ``/tank/projects/<date>/icechunk_v2``) — no GRIB staging, no upload.

Schema (native N320 reduced-Gaussian cells, no regrid at write time)::

    coords: latitude(values) f4, longitude(values) f4,
            time(time) i4 (seconds since reference_date), member(member) i4
    data:   one (member, time, values) f4/f2 array per model output field
            (ALL fields kept, incl. cos_mwd/sin_mwd — a gain over the GRIB path)

Typical use (single process, sequential members)::

    repo = open_repo_local("/tank/projects/20260625_0000/icechunk_v2")
    init_schema(repo, n_members=50, n_steps=12, n_values=542080,
                var_names=first_state_field_names,
                latitudes=lats, longitudes=lons,
                ref_date=ref_date, timestep_s=6*3600)      # once, before any writer
    w = IcechunkMemberWriter(repo, member_index=member-1)  # member 1 -> index 0
    for state in runner.run(...):
        w.write_step(state)
    w.commit(member)
